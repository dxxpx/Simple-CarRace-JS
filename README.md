This repository contains the source code of my racing game prototype.
It's an old school pseudo 3d racer, where your goal is to drive a car, as fast as possible through heavy traffic.

The game is programmed in Javascript using [Phaser 2 framework](http://phaser.io/).

## Part 1 - Straight Road
This part covers the following:
- initializing a new Phaser game
- creating the main game loop
- implementing 3d projection
- building a straight road
- rendering the road

## Part 2 - Adding Player
This part covers the following:
- creating the Player class
- updating the camera to follow the player
- adding a clipping line to render only segments above it
- making the road to correctly loops back
